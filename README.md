## Analysis
#
This module creates dynamic content with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and bootstrap.
#
## Overview
#
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive web page for Dana's users to parse the data
around UFO sightings.
#
### Methodology
#
The data is in a JavaScript data file.  The data was transformed into an HTML table using JavaScript.  The table was built by iterating through an array of objects and appending them to 
a table row.  Code was written to loop through the data rows, with each row containing the contents of one siting, e.g. date, city, state, country, shape of UFO.
#
### Tools
#
The tools used were JavaScript, HTML, CSS and bootstrap.  A web page was built with filter capability on each of the characteristics of a sighting, e.g. date, city, state, country, shape of UFO, allowing a user to select what filtered set of sightings they are interested in.  D3.js was used to listen for events that occur on the webpage, in this case, entering filter parameters. 
#
### Results
#
The dynamic web page allowed filtering based on date, city, state, countyr and shape.

How to perform a search, with images
## Summary
JavasScript and the ES6 update from 2015 make complex, interactive form building easier.
This comes in handy for building online shopping websites with many options for shoppers,
tracking large data sets for weather (NSIDC) or large and diverse datasets requiring 
dynamic tables (NEON).
### Drawbacks
JavasScript is syntax intensive and case sensitive.  The coding requires statements and expressions and
code blocks that are different from other programming languages, requiring coders to memorize rules and 
practice the coding a lot.  The code can also be difficult to read, since it can all be one line.  Javascript
also requires DevTools console to test the code.
